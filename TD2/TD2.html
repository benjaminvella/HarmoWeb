        <p>
            Files and data received by the user can be modified by the user. And the user can be a hacker searching for vulnerability.
            ALWAYS consider (especially on the web) that some of your users will try and find every backdoor in your code.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases (showcase websites for instance) everything is public and there are no confidential data whatsoever, so it's OK to put all the logic in the front-side.
            But that's not always the case: for instance, I guess you wouldn't want your private conversations to be public and accessible to anyone pretending to be you.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure only the authorized users access a content, we need to implement verifications in a code user cannot access. That's called the back-side (opposite to front-side),
            and to allow the front-side to communicate securely to the back-side, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" target="_blank">APIs</a> are used.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lab, you will learn how to implement a basic sign-in/login platform.

            <h2>Exercise 0 - Node.Js</h2>
            <p>
                A Server is a program listening to communications of a given port on the machine it is running on, and executing some code whenever a request is received.
                We would like to create a server using JavaScript, but JS cannot be launched natively on computers (Operating Systems don't natively have the tools to understand and
                execute JS): we need a program which containing a JS engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. It is a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank">Command-Line Interface (CLI)</a> using <a href="https://v8.dev/" target="_blank">V8</a>
                (Google Chrome's JavaScript engine) to let users run JS directly on their machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure the installation went smoothly, open a command prompt and type <span class="inlineCode">node -v</span>, you should see the node version you installed.
            </p>

            <h2>Exercise 1 - Server creation</h2>
            <p>
                The first step is to create a simple server which listens to HTTP requests of a given port and responds by sending back a text containing some information about the request.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a folder in TD2 called server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open a command prompt, go to the server folder, and type <span class="inlineCode">npm init -y</span> (npm is Node Package Manager, the init command initializes a node project,
                    and the -y argument says yes to all the questions npm is asking. If you want you can remove the -y parameter and answer the questions, but that's not the purpose of this exercise).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create, in the same folder, an <span class="inlineCode">index.js</span> file in which we will write the code for our server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inside this file, call the http.createServer function and make your server listen to port 8765 (because why not). Don't forget to <span class="inlineCode">require</span>
                    the necessary module.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set your response's <span class="inlineCode">statusCode</span> to 200, and add a header for 'Content-Type' whose value is 'text/html'. Send the response with a text indicating
                    the method and the url of the request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return to your command prompt and run the command <span class="inlineCode">node index.js</span> ;
                    then open your browser and type in the URL <span class="inlineCode">localhost:8765</span> ; check that the message you sent from the server is correctly displayed in the browser.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Exercise 2 - DB creation</h2>
            <p>
                As explained above, we cannot trust the client, so we need to save important data server-side. To do so, we need a database. For this lab we will use a simple SQL Database, sqlite3.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go to your command prompt, in your server folder, and type <span class="inlineCode">npm install sqlite3</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In your index.js, "import" the sqlite3 module: <span class="inlineCode">const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before the call to the <span class="inlineCode">createServer</span> function, define a variable <span class="inlineCode">db</span> and initialize it by calling
                    <span class="inlineCode">sqlite3.Database</span> constructor. The first argument is the name of your db file (let put <span class="inlineCode">my.db</span>) ;
                    the second argument is the opening mode, we will use <span class="inlineCode">sqlite3.OPEN_READWRITE</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If not given as argument on the db constructor, the default opening mode is <span class="inlineCode">sqlite3.OPEN_READWRITE | sqlite3.OPEN_CREATE</span>.
                    By removing <span class="inlineCode">sqlite3.OPEN_CREATE</span>, we ensured an error is thrown if the db doesn't exist.
                    <span class="inlineCode">sqlite3.Database</span> constructor can take a third argument which is a callback function taking 1 argument: an error (or null if everything went well).
                    Add this function to the constructor. It should check if an error has been given, and if so call the Database constructor with 2 arguments: the filename and the callback
                    (in the callback, create a user table in the DB:
                    <span class="inlineCode">db2.run('CREATE TABLE user(username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, password TEXT NOT NULL, secretMessage TEXT)');</span>
                    and put the newly created db in the <span class="inlineCode">db</span> variable.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After that, your index.js should have a variable <span class="inlineCode">db</span> containing the currently opened db, either directly if it already existed or after being created
                in the callback. Add console.log at each step, and run <span class="inlineCode">node index.js</span> in your command prompt. The first run, the callback of the first
                constructor should have an error (since the db doesn't exist yet), but every other runs the db should be directly opened.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Exercise 3 - Sign-in</h2>
            <p>
                Now that the DB is running, we need to save information on it.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the end of this page (TD2.html) you will find an article whose title is sign-in. Add 3 <span class="inlineCode">&lt;input&gt;</span> with 3 labels
                    (username, password, and secret message) and a button called "Sign in".
                </li>
                <li>
                    In TD2.js, add an event listener to this button, which should retrieve the content of all 3 inputs, and send a POST request to localhost:8765/signin containing those 3 fields.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optional: check that the inputs are not empty before sending the request. You can even force password to follow some rules
                    (you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions" target="_blank">Regular Expressions</a> to normalize what you expect).
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the <span class="inlineCode">createServer</span> callback, remove the code from exercise 1, and instead check if the URL is a POST to /signin. If so:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Retrieve the username, password and secret message from the request
                            (see how <a href="https://nodejs.dev/fr/learn/get-http-request-body-data-using-nodejs/" target="_blank">here</a>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Saving clear password in DB is a bad habit because if the db gets compromised for whatever reason, user's password would be directly visible. To avoid that,
                            we can encrypt the password. For that, we will use SHA-256. First, install the module <span class="inlineCode">js-sha256</span>. Then, import it by adding
                            <span class="inlineCode">const sha256 = require('js-sha256').sha256;</span> on top of the index.js file. Finally, store in a variable the hash of the password by using
                            <span class="inlineCode">sha256(password);</span>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Insert the user's information in the database. You can find how to do that <a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-nodejs/insert/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                            In the callback, send the response indicating if it worked (statusCode 201 CREATED ; if an error occurred, the returned code should depend on the error, so let's use
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol" target="_blank">418 I'm a teapot</a>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Optional: before saving in the db the username/password, check if the username already exist, in which case update the password / secret message.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Optional: in TD2.js, add a finish handler to the query to /signin and write a message in the console saying if the call went well or not.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test your server by launching it (node index.js), filling the inputs in TD2.html and clicking the Sign in button. <br>
                    You may have problems with Options and CORS. This is due to a policy about cross-origin requests and is supposed to reinforce security (see CORS for more info). To fix that,
                    handle cases where the request is not a POST but an OPTION, and always add to your response the following headers:<br>
                    <span class="inlineCode">response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");</span><br>
                    <span class="inlineCode">response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH"]);</span><br>
                    <span class="inlineCode">response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "*");</span><br>
                    NOTE: those values are totally unsafe and destroy all CORS principles. However, they allow any request to work immediately which is the focus in this lab.

            <h2>Exercise 4 - Connexion</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we can signin users, let's log them in.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In TD2.html, update the #login article to add username/password inputs and a "Log in" button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In TD2.js, add an event listener to the Log in button, and send a POST request to localhost:8765/login containing the 2 inputs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In index.js, add a check for POST requests to /login. In this case, run a SQL query to select the username of the user if the password match
                    (<span class="inlineCode">db.get(`SELECT username FROM user WHERE username=? and password=?`, [data.username, data.password], function(error, result) {});</span>) :
                    if an error occurs, return it ; Otherwise we now want to return an information that the front will be able to use to guarantee the user is logged in while being secure.
                    For that, we will encrypt a token server-side, and send it to the client. Since the client cannot decrypt it, the server can ensure the content of the token is correct.
                    To do that, we will use JWToken:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="inlineCode">npm install jsonwebtoken</span>
                        </li>

                            In your index.js (outside every function, at the top of the file) define a variable secretCode containing a string of your choice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Update the login logic so that if the username/password are found in the db, the value sent in the response is the username but encrypted by JWT
                            (you can use <span class="inlineCode">jwt.sign({username: username}, secretCode, {expiresIn: "1d"});</span> to do so).
                        </li>
